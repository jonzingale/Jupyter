    "* Possible worlds exist – they are just as real as our world;\n",
    "* Possible worlds are the same sort of things as our world – they differ in content, not in kind;\n",
    "* Possible worlds cannot be reduced to something more basic – they are irreducible entities in their own right.\n",
    "* Actuality is indexical. When we distinguish our world from other possible worlds by claiming that it alone is actual, we mean only that it is our world.\n",
    "* Possible worlds are unified by the spatiotemporal interrelations of their parts; every world is spatiotemporally isolated from every other world.\n",
    "* Possible worlds are causally isolated from each other."
