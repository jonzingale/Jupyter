    "(Note: In reading the following, you should think of a logical system as a notion of category-with-structure, and particular theories within that logical system as particular such categories-with-structure; propositions correspond to objects, morphisms to proofs of entailments/sequents, and equality of morphisms to equality (in a suitable proof-theoretic sense) of proofs. Thus, Hom(𝐴,𝐵) corresponds, in some sense, to (the set of proofs of) 𝐴⊢𝐵. Furthermore, 𝐴∧𝐵 (conjunction) corresponds to the categorical product 𝐴×𝐵 [as the nullary case, ⊤ (empty conjunction; i.e., truth) corresponds to the terminal object 1], and 𝐴⊃𝐵 (implication) corresponds to the categorical exponential 𝐵𝐴. The modal operator □, in turn, is a product-preserving endofunctor whose exact further details are not of terrible importance to us right now)\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s two slightly different senses in which one might refer to the “deduction theorem”: one is the sense in which proofs of 𝛤⊢𝐴⊃𝐵 correspond to proofs of 𝛤∧𝐴⊢𝐵; this is just the defining adjunction of exponentiation in a cartesian closed category, which can be viewed as the intro/elim rules for implication in a suitably sequent-style presentation. This still holds perfectly well in provability logic. This is the sense referred to by Mike Shulman above (though not using the term “deduction theorem”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another sense in which one might refer to the “deduction theorem” is as a sense in which proofs of 𝐴⊢𝐵, in the background context of whatever assumed entailments, correspond to proofs of ⊤⊢𝐵 given the further assumption of an entailment ⊤⊢𝐴; that is, as a correspondence between morphisms from 𝐴 to 𝐵 in a category-with-structure 𝐶, on the one hand, and, on the other, global sections of 𝐵 in the free category-with-structure extending 𝐶 with a global section of 𝐴. For example, cartesian closed categories (modelling propositional intuitionistic logic) have this property as well; freely augmenting a cartesian closed category C with a global section of some object A results in the Kleisli category C[A] of the functor 𝐴∧−, and there is an obvious correspondence between 𝐶[𝐴](⊤,𝐵) and 𝐶(𝐴,𝐵).\n",
    "\n",
    "This second sense is the sense of “the deduction theorem” which fails in provability logic, suitably construed; provability logic does indeed allow one to conclude ⊤⊢□𝐴 from ⊤⊢𝐴, as noted, but does not have 𝐴⊢□𝐴 as a general theorem. (A more categorical way to put this failure is that the □ functor is not an enriched functor [for the cartesian closed structure]; we do not have 𝐴⊃𝐵⊢□𝐴⊃□𝐵. The failure of this functor to be enriched with respect to internal implication is characteristic of “modality”)\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the distinction between the two senses of “the deduction theorem” is once again one between different levels of entailment; the turnstile of sequents vs. the horizontal line of rules of inference between sequents (an even more “external” level of entailment than the turnstile), which is to say, looking at the hom-sets of a category vs. looking at the result of freely adding a global section to a category.\n",
