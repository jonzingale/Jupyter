    "__3. Why directed limits and categorical description__?<br>\n",
    "Categories give a formal and rigorous framework for describing many phenomena pertaining to human experience. For instance; the category $Set$ encodes intuitions regarding size, the category $Vect$ encodes intuitions regarding dimension, and the category $Group$ encodes intuitions regarding symmetry. When we objectify a thing, attributing the property of having this or that symmetry to it, we can trace transformations of or comparisons with this symmetry via mappings between groups. Formal metaphors relating one kind of property to another can then be construed as relations between categories. In the local jargon, these relations between categories are called functors.<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The construction of directed limits is general enough that if we can construct such an inductive limit for $Vect$ and another for $Group$, we may be readily able to relate both systems unambiguously. This *higher level* quality of categorical metaphor-making is possibly what we need to speak about inference. When we make an abduction, for instance, we do not specify a class devoid of context. Rather, we aim to place the class in a constellation of inter-related classes, ie. a system of metaphors."
