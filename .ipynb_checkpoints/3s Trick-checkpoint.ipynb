    "## The 3s Trick for English Majors.\n",

    "I will here attempt a proof of the threes trick for English majors. As is readily noticed, whenever a numbers digits are divisible by three the number itself is divisible by three. By divisible we mean that whenever a number `n` is divided by another number `d` there is a remainder of zero. But what is a remainder?<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "__Definition.__ (remainder of a division)<br>\n",
    "A natural number `r` is a remainder of `d` dividing `n` whenever one can find an integer `q` such that `n = dq + r`. The remainder is the smallest such `r`. For instance, if `d=5` and `n=23` we can find an integer `q=3` giving `23 = 5(4) + r`. Here, the remainder `r` is 3. For notational simplicity in what follows, let $[n]_d$ denote the remainder when `n` is divided by `d`. Note that when `d` is a factor of `n` then $[n]_d$ = 0.<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire game of proving the 3s trick will rely on understanding how the remainder of a division problem is effected by adding and multiplying numbers. If a number `n` is divisible by three and both adding to `n` in clever ways and multiplying by `n` in clever ways leave the remainder unchanged then whatever number is finally arrived at will also be divisible by three. The following lemmas will help to establish what is meant by clever.<br> \n",
    "\n",
    "__Lemma 1.__<br>\n",
    "Remainders are 'preserved' by addition, ie. Summing two numbers and then dividing by `d` gives the same remainder as dividing both numbers by `d`, summing the remainders and then again dividing by `d`. In the fancy short hand of the definition above: $[n+m]_d=[[n]_d+[m]_d]_d$<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "__proof:__<br>\n",
    "Let `n` and `m` be integers which can be written in the forms `n = dq + r` and `m = dp + s`,<br>\n",
    "with d being the same in both expressions. Here `r` is the remainder when dividing `n` by `d`<br>\n",
    "and `s` is the remainder when dividing `m` by `d`. It can be seen algebraically that:<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "$n+m$<br>\n",
    "$(dq + r)+(dp+s)$ # by assumption<br>\n",
    "$(dq + dp) + (r+s)$ # associating the parts with ds and then those without.<br>\n",
    "$d(q+p) + (r+s)$<p>\n",
    "`d` divides `d(q+p)` and so `r+s` determines the remainder of dividing `n+m` by `d`.<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "__Corollary.__<br>\n",
    "Two numbers divisible by `d` yield a sum divisible by `d`,<br>\n",
    "$[n+m]_d = 0 \\implies [[n]_d + [m]_d]_d = 0$<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "__Lemma 2.__<br>\n",
    "Remainders are 'preserved' by multiplication,\n",
    "$[nm]_d=[[n]_m[m]_d]_d$<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "__proof:__<br>\n",
    "Similar to the proof of Lemma 1, we can write integers<br>\n",
    "`n` and `m` in the forms `n = dq + r` and `m = dp + s`.<br>\n",
    "Algebraically it follows that:<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "$n*m$<br>\n",
    "$(dq+r)(dp+s)$<br>\n",
    "$d^2pq+dqs+dpr+rs$<br>\n",
    "$d(dpq+qs+pr)+rs$<p>\n",
    "`d` divides $d(dpq+qs+pr)$ and so does not contribute to any change in the remainder.<br>\n",
    "Thus, the remainder of dividing `n*m` by d is determined by `r*s`.<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to prove the main theorem.<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "__Theorem.__ (the 3s trick)<br>\n",
    "If 3 divides the sum of the digits of n then 3 divides n.<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "__proof:__<br>\n",
    "Let's begin by recalling that every natural number `n` can be written in what is called its m-ary representation,<br>\n",
    "namely, as $n=\\sum_{i=0}a_i*10^i=a_0+a_1+a_2+...+a_n$. For example, the number 1234 can be written as<br>\n",
    "$1*10^0+2*10^1+3*10^2+4*10^3$. By the corollary to Lemma 1, if the sum of a bunch of numbers is<br>\n",
    "divisible by 3 then dividing a bunch of numbers by 3 and summing their remainders will give a number<br>\n",
    "divisible by 3.<p>\n",
    "$[\\sum_{i=0}a_i]_3=[\\sum_{i=0}{[a_i]_3}]_3$<p>\n",
    "Dividing 10 by 3 gives a remainder of 1 and multiplication preserves remainders by Lemma 2.<br>\n",
    "This means that multiplying a number by 10 or any powers of 10 will not change the remainder.<br>\n",
    "This is because multiplying by 10 has the effect of multiplying the remainder by 1.<p>\n",
    "Given that $\\sum_{i=0}a_i=a_0+a_1+a_2+...+a_n$, we can multiply any individual coefficient $a_i$<br>\n",
    "by a power of 10 and leave the remainder unchanged. Thus, $[\\sum_{i=0}{a_i*10^i}]_3=0$, ie.<br>\n",
    "$\\sum_{i=0}{a_i*10^i}$ is divisible by 3, which was to be shown.<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Again in the fancy notation:<p>\n",
    "$[\\sum{a_i}]_d=0$ # by premise<br>\n",
    "$\\sum{[a_i]_d}=0$ # by Lemma 1<br>\n",
    "$\\sum{[a_i]_d*[1]_d}=0$<br>\n",
    "$\\sum{[a_i]_d*[10^i]_d}=0$ # by substitional equivalence<br>\n",
    "$\\sum{[a_i*10^i]_d}=0$ # by Lemma 2<br>\n",
    "$[\\sum{a_i*10^i}]_d=0$ # by Lemma 1<br>\n",
    "3 divides $\\sum{a_i*10^i}$ # by definition of remainders.<p>\n",
